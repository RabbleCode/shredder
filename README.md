# shredder

shredder (short for Shredder Operating Manual) is a simple addon for World of Warcraft: Classic that tracks progress on the Horde quest chain The Lost Pages (Shredder Operating Manual).

Usage:

- `/shredder` - displays progress for each chapter (I-III) of the overall quest and which pages are still needed on the current character
- `/shredder name` - displays progress for character named "name" on the same realm as the currently logged in character
- `/shredder name realm` - displays progress for character named "name" on the realm named "realm". Supports realms with spaces in name, e.g. `/shredder Thrall Lava Lash` will search for a character named "Thrall" on the realm "Lava Lash"
